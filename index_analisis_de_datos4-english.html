      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        Welcome to the data analysis project for IFood! In this project, we will analyze data from a <b>food delivery company in Brazil</b>. The reason for the project is the need for the marketing department to <b>spend their annual budget more intelligently</b>. The CMO perceives the importance of taking a more quantitative approach when making decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A small team of data scientists was hired with a clear goal: <b> to build a predictive model </b> that would support direct marketing initiatives. Ideally, the success of these activities will demonstrate the value of the approach and convince the skeptics within the company.<b> We will mainly use the R tool to build the model.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>About Ifood</h2>
    <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
    </div>

    <p>
      IFood is a <b>food delivery company</b>through an app that operates in the food retail sector. It has several hundred thousand registered customers and serves almost one million consumers per year. They sell products from 5 main categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic fruits, specially prepared fish, and sweet products. These can also be divided into "gold" and regular products. 
  </p>


  <p>
    Globally, the company had solid revenues in the last 3 years, but <b>las perspectivas de crecimiento no son prometedoras...</b> For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered, one of which is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on marketing campaigns.   
    </p>

      <h2>Actions taken</h2>
  
      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> <b>Definition of the business task: </b> The first thing we did was to examine the input of the stakeholders to determine what the business task was. </li>
          <li> <b>Data study: </b> The next action was to study the properties of the data (type and characteristics) and its context (metadata and origin). This way, it was determined that the data was of quality and did not have bias.</li>
          <li> <b>SMART Questions: </b> Then, we defined the SMART questions that we expected to answer through this data analysis project. These questions provided a guide to what we wanted to analyze.</li>
          <li> <b>Data preparation: </b> We then proceeded to prepare the data, ensuring that the data was in the appropriate format to work with later. In addition, the data was filtered and classified for better cleaning in the next phase.</li>
          <li> <b>Data cleaning and processing:</b> The next activity was data cleaning, where duplicates, null data, and errors were sought. Then, data was separated and merged where appropriate.</li>
          <li> <b>Data analysis:</b> With the data ready to work, different data analysis, statistical, and data visualization tools were used. Among some, we can mention: R, tableau, and SQL. Then observations were made of the findings to subsequently append them to the project report.</li>
          </ol>
      </p>




      <h2>Business task</h2>

      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        The business task is to "<b>build a predictive model that produces the highest gain for the next marketing campaign, scheduled for next month.</b>" The new campaign, the sixth, aims to sell a new device to the customer database.
      </p>

      <h2>About the data</h2>
      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
       <b>To build the model, a pilot campaign involving 2,240 customers was conducted.</b> The customers were randomly selected and contacted by phone for the acquisition of the device. The total cost of the sample campaign was <b>6,720 MBR</b>, and the revenue generated by customers who accepted the offer was <b> 3.674 MBR.</b></p>

      <p>
        Globally, the campaign had a benefit of <b>-3.046MBR.</b> The success rate of the campaign was 15%. Hopefully, the model will allow the company to choose customers who are more likely to buy the offer and leave out those who did not respond, making the next campaign highly profitable.
