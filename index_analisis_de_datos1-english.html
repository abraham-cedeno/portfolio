      <p>
        Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share case study! In this case study, I will be working as a data analyst for the company Cyclistic. I have been provided with a 
          <b>massive dataset</b> 
          containing over 6 million records. To effectively analyze it, I will be using tools such as        
          <b>SQL, R y Tableau.</b> 
          Let's get started!
      </p>
   

      <h2>About Cyclistic</h2>

      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        Cyclistic is a ficticious bike-sharing company launched in Chicago in 2016. Its marketing strategy is based on flexible pricing that includes single-ride passes, day passes, and annual memberships. Financial analysts have concluded that the future growth of the company will depend on maximizing the number of     
        <b> annual members.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The marketing team's goal is to convert
        <b>casual riders</b>
        into
        <b>annual members.</b>
        To achieve this, they need to study the differences between the two groups and how digital media can affect their strategy. An analyst is assigned to the team to examine historical bike trip data and help create an effective marketing strategy.

        <ol>
          <li> <b>Define the business task: </b> The first step was to examine the input from stakeholders to determine what the business task was. </li>
          <li> <b>Data study:</b>The next action was to study the properties of the data (type and characteristics) and its context (metadata and origin). This way it was determined that the data was of good quality and did not contain bias.</li>
          <li> <b>SMART Questions:</b> The SMART questions that were expected to be answered through this data analysis project were defined next. These questions provided a guide of what needed to be analyzed.</li>
          <li> <b>Scope Of Work:</b> A SOW was created to define the purpose of this data analysis project, the activities to be carried out, the project timeline with time estimates, the deliverables, and the project scope. </li>
          <li> <b>Data preparation:</b> The data was then prepared, ensuring that it was in the appropriate format for later work. Additionally, the data was filtered and classified for better cleaning in the next phase.</li>
          <li> <b>Data cleaning and processing:</b> The next activity was data cleaning where duplicates, null data, and errors were searched for. Then, data was separated and merged where considered appropriate.</li>
          <li> <b>Record of data treatment:</b> A document was also created that recorded all relevant transformations that were made to the data before starting the analysis.</li>  
          <li> <b>Data analysis:</b> With the data ready to work with, various data analysis, statistical, and data visualization tools were used. Some of these tools included R, Tableau, and SQL. Observations of the findings were made to subsequently include them in the project report.</li>
          <li> <b>Report generation and results presentation:</b> Finally, a report was created that was presented to stakeholders with the project findings. Additionally, relevant recommendations were made based on what was found during the analysis.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Business task</h2>

      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to study the historical bike trip data of Cyclistic's different customer types
      <b>(casual riders and members), </b>
      particularly over the last 12 months, to understand how they use Cyclistic bikes differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results obtained in this project will be key for the marketing team to determine the most effective
        <b>digital marketing strategies. </b>
        These strategies will allow them to connect with Cyclistic's audience and influence casual riders to opt for an
        <b>annual membership.</b>
