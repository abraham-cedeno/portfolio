      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        In this project, I will be working as a data analyst for the ficticious company AdventureWorks. I was provided with a dataset and asked to design a comprehensive business intelligence solution. To achieve this, I primarily used the <b>Power BI</b> tool. Let's get started!
      </p>
   

      <h2>About AdventureWorks</h2>

      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        AdventureWorks is a global manufacturing company that realizes the importance of data analysis for decision-making. The company needs a way to track its KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns).
           <p>
            The only thing provided to me to create this comprehensive solution is a folder of raw csv files containing information on <b>transactions, returns, products, customers, and territories.</b>
              </p>

      <h2>Actions taken</h2>
  
      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> <b>Definition of the business task:</b> The first thing done was to examine the stakeholders' input to determine the business task. </li>
          <li> <b>Data study:</b> The next action was to study the data properties (type and characteristics) and its context (metadata and origin). This determined that the data was of good quality and did not have bias.</li>
          <li> <b>Data import and transformation:</b> After studying the data properties, the data was imported and transformed to ensure its quality and prepare it for further analysis. The Power Query tool was used for this process, ensuring that the data is clean, complete, and structured correctly.</li>
          <li> <b>Construction of a relational data model:</b> Once the data was prepared, a relational data model was constructed to organize the information coherently and logically. The necessary tables and relationships were defined to reflect the entities and their interactions in the real world.</li>
          <li> <b>Creation of new calculated columns and DAX measures: </b> After building the relational data model, new calculated columns and DAX measures were created to perform advanced calculations and analysis. The appropriate functions were used for each case, and the results were validated to ensure their accuracy.</li>  
          <li> <b>Design of an interactive report:</b> Finally, an interactive report was designed to present the information visually and easily understandable. A BI tool was used to create visualizations and charts that allow users to explore the data intuitively and find relevant patterns and trends. </li>
        </ol>
      </p>






      <h2>Business task</h2>

      <div class="blue_line snipcss-V6C8f">
      </div>

      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard with clear visualizations that facilitate understanding of the information for the users.    
     </p>
      <p>
        This dashboard must meet the following: <b>provide a tracking of the company's key performance indicators, compare regional performance, analyze product trend levels, contain projections, and identify high-value customers. </b>  </p>

        <li class="data">
          <b>Identification of data tables and lookup tables:</b>
          The first step was to identify the data tables (AW_Sales and AW_Returns), which contain granular information about customers. Then, lookup tables were defined with descriptive information for each attribute in the data tables.
            </li>
        <li class="data">
          <b>Recognition of primary and foreign keys in the tables:</b>
          The data and lookup tables were analyzed to recognize the primary and foreign keys in each of them. This information was used to establish the necessary relationships between the tables and ensure that the data is coherent and logical in the relational data model.
           <li class="data">
          <b>Establishment of relationships between the tables:</b>
          After recognizing the primary and foreign keys in the tables, the necessary relationships between them were established. Power BI was used to establish the relationships between the tables and ensure that the data is coherent and logical in the relational data model.

      <br>
      <b>Implementation Methodology</b>
      <p>
        After constructing the relational data model and establishing the necessary relationships between the tables, new calculated columns and DAX measures were created to perform advanced calculations and analysis. These new columns allowed users to conduct deeper analysis and obtain more detailed information about the company's KPIs.
      </p>
        <p>
          The appropriate functions were used for each case, and the results were validated to ensure their accuracy and reliability. The creation of these new columns and measures was an important step in ensuring that users can make informed and accurate decisions based on the data available in the relational data model.

                <b>Dashboard Content</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                The dashboard has 3 sections:
                <ul>
                  <li class="data">
                    <b>Executive Summary</b>
                                 </li>
                  <li class="data">
                    <b>Product Details</b>
                  
                    <li class="data">
                    <b>Customer Details</b>
          </li>

              </ul>

          

                <p>
                  After constructing the relational data model and creating new calculated columns and DAX measures, an interactive report was designed in Power BI. This report allowed information to be visualized in a more user-friendly and easy-to-understand way.
                   </p>


                  <p>
                    The best data visualization practices were used in designing the report, ensuring that the report is intuitive and easy to use. Charts and tables were included that showed the company's most important KPIs.
                        </p>

                  <p>
                    Furthermore, it was ensured that the report is responsive and can be viewed on different devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The resulting interactive report was a very useful tool for decision-making, allowing users to access relevant and up-to-date information quickly and efficiently.
                         </p>
